# RAG-Chatbot

This script implements a chat logging system using SQLite for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. It stores user queries, AI responses, session IDs, and timestamps in a database, retrieves chat history for a session, and integrates with an AI model to provide contextual responses.
